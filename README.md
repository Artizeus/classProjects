# Summary of University of Iowa class projects
## Data Structures Project:
#### Used Java data structures to answer queries regarding flights using statistics extracted from a dataset from the United States Department of Transportation's (USDOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)
#### Refactored this code using declarative query language and implenting caching to strengthen code's reusability and extensibility

## CS2110 Project:
#### Used Python's tkinter GUI library and Google's Static Maps and Geocoding API to display maps of searchable locations
#### Extended this program using Twitter's API to display locations of Tweets matching user specific search terms with the capibility to display each Tweet

## Software Development Project:
#### Worked together with a team of three other programmers in an Agile Scrum process to create two Java classes for an extensive code base while adhering to coding standards. The code bases primary purpose is to develop programs for network communication in wireless sensor networks. 
#### The classes that we wrote produced a Latency Analysis file that shows the flows and time slots for the Scheduler. 
#### We created high level plans and a UML Sequence Diagram before starting, wrote JavaDoc updates for all code, and created JUnit tests to make sure our methods were effective.
